1.What is the general trend in the curve?

The curve has sharp drop and steep increase thoughout the percentage of data.

2.Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others?  Why?

No, even after running the code several times, there is no noise. 

3.How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?

At least 300 trials but the curve is not very smooth and takes a very long.

4.Try different values for C (by changing LogisticRegression(C=10**-10)).  What happens?  If you want to know why this happens, see this Wikipedia page as well as the documentation for LogisticRegression in scikit-learn.

The graph changes from increasing to decreasing as -10 increase to positive number.
